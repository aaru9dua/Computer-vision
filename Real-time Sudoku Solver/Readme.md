# Problem Description
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzles of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to fill a 9x9 grid
such that each row, each column and 3x3 grid contains all of the digits between 1 to 9.In this
project we aim to create a real time Sudoku solver which recognizes the elements of Sudoku
puzzles and provides a digital solution using Computer vision.Sudoku Solver is the collection
of very basic image processing techniques. A very good way to start is the OpenCV library
which can be compiled on almost all the platforms.

<h2>Software Requirements</h2>
<li>OpenCV-for handling image processing</li>
<li>Numpy-for handling numeric data</li>
<li>Tersseract- for optical character recognition (OCR) tool</li>

<h2>Algorithmic Approach</h2>
Majorly there are <b>Three main steps</b>to solve our problem.
<ol>
  <li><b>Extracting Sudoku grid from our webcam Image</b></li>
    The first one is to extract the Sudoku grid from our webcam Image and Fig 1 shows how to proceed step by step in achieving this task.
