# Problem Description
Sudoku is one of the most popular puzzles of all time. The goal of Sudoku is to Vill a 9x9 grid
such that each row, each column and 3x3 grid contains all of the digits between 1 to 9.In this
project we aim to create a real time Sudoku solver which recognizes the elements of Sudoku
puzzles and provides a digital solution using Computer vision.Sudoku Solver is the collection
of very basic image processing techniques. A very good way to start is the OpenCV library
which can be compiled on almost all the platforms.
